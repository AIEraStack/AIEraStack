  "summary": "The JS/TS AI SDK landscape has matured into a two-tier ecosystem: low-level provider SDKs (OpenAI, Anthropic) focused on reliability, and high-level orchestration frameworks (Vercel AI SDK, LangChain) focused on developer productivity. OpenAI remains the gold standard for production stability and feature velocity, while LangChain continues to dominate complex multi-step reasoning workflows. Vercel's AI SDK is rapidly becoming the preferred choice for Next.js and frontend-heavy applications due to its seamless streaming integration and superior momentum.",
