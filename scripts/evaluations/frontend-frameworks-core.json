  "summary": "The 2026 frontend landscape is defined by the convergence of server-side performance and reactive DX, with Astro leading the shift toward content-driven multi-framework architectures. While React 19 stabilizes the use of Server Components and the new React Compiler, rivals like Angular and Vue have pivoted heavily toward Signal-based reactivity to eliminate legacy bottlenecks. This comparison highlights a maturing ecosystem where 'all-in-one' frameworks are increasingly judged by their AI-assisted development efficiency and zero-bundle-size potential.",
  "recommendations": {
    "forNewProjects": {
      "repo": "withastro/astro",
      "reason": "Astro's Content Layer API and 'Islands' architecture provide the most scalable foundation for modern, performance-first websites, allowing teams to mix frameworks as needed while maintaining a zero-JS baseline. Its automatic optimization of images and assets significantly reduces the initial technical debt associated with core web vitals."
    },
    "forAICoding": {
      "repo": "withastro/astro",
      "reason": "Astro's highly structured component syntax and clear separation of frontmatter (server) and template (client) make it exceptionally easy for LLMs to generate correct, isolated code blocks. Its explicit 'client:' directives provide clear intent that AI tools like Cursor and Copilot can leverage to minimize hydrate-related bugs."
    },
    "forMigrations": {
      "repo": "facebook/react",
      "reason": "Despite newer competition, React's massive ecosystem provides the most robust migration path via codemods and community-driven bridges (like million.js or preact-compat). React 19's focus on stabilizing backward compatibility for Server Components makes it the safest long-term bet for large legacy codebases."
